# Spoken Word Creator

AI-powered narrative transformation system designed to convert complex issues, policy briefs, or personal stories into structured spoken word poetry.

Built as an early prototype of the narrative reasoning layer behind ArtsEnvoy.ai.

## Purpose

Most AI poetry generators produce generic verse.

Spoken Word Creator encodes:

- Cadence patterns
- Metaphor density
- Emotional arc
- Structural pacing
- Voice consistency

This system was refined using patterns from the bestselling poetry memoir *You Will Not Erase Me*, translating authorial voice into structured prompt architecture.

## How It Works

Input:
- Policy excerpt OR personal story OR social issue

Processing:
- Extract core emotional stakes
- Identify speaker perspective
- Build narrative arc
- Apply spoken-word rhythm pattern
- Insert metaphor clusters + refrain logic

Output:
- Performance-ready spoken word poetry

## Architecture

- Python
- Structured prompt templates
- Modular transformation pipeline
- LLM orchestration layer (model-agnostic)
- Expandable voice encoding logic

## Why It Matters

This project demonstrates that narrative craft can be embedded into AI systems — not just content generated.

It became a foundational experiment for the broader Advocacy OS narrative engine.
